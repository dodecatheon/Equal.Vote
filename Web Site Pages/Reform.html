<p><strong>Revolutionary Reform: The Oregon Way</strong></p>

<p><img src="Capitol_Wall.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Oregon has long led the nation in innovative reform proposals, from the initiative system itself to the Beach Bill, Bottle Bill and Vote-by-Mail, and Motor Voter just to name a few. Given the state of our national politics today, it's time for Oregon to step up again and demonstrate that a better way forward is possible.</p>

<p>We've crafted a simple three-phase plan to fundamentally reboot our national democratic process.<br><br></p>

<p><strong>Phase 1: Start Local</strong>
<p>We have drafted a <a href="Lane_County_Charter_Amendment.pdf">short amendment</a> to the Lane County charter we intend to put on the November, 2017 ballot. Do you live in an Oregon charter county too? If you're here in Lane, join us! If not, you should check out your charter and see how easy it is to get SRV done in your county too! This will allow real voters to use SRV in a real election as soon as May of 2018. Our amendment text is currently undergoing legal review, and will be submitted before the end of the year to local elections officials.</p>

<p><strong>Phase 2: Democracy - an Oregon First</strong>

<p>Oregon's Legislative Counsel has been engaged to draft a significant election reform law that will be considered in the 2017 legislature and ultimately aimed at the November 2018 ballot. The broad strokes of the reform are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Switch the voting method from plurality to Score Runoff for all elections.</strong> This one is clear: Score Runoff Voting is a giant democracy leap beyond the Plurality Voting system we use today. And this change won't even require amending our state Constitution: Article II section 16 of the Oregon Constitution specifically allows for alternate voting methods to be implemented by statute. It reads, "Provision may be made by law for the voter&rsquo;s direct or indirect expression of his first, second or additional choices among the candidates for any office." Nice!<br /><br /></li>

<li><strong>Abolish the state and local Primary Election.</strong> Let's double up on voter equality. The partisan primary election is what forces candidates to run two campaigns, raise more money, and change their messages midway through as they are considered by two distinct electorates. The Primary is also what gives us "safe" districts that shut out half of the electorate.<br><br></li>

<li><strong>Change the ballot for all partisan elections to show both a candidate's party affiliation and which party or parties have endorsed that candidate.</strong><br><br><img src="State_ballot.png"><br><br>Multiple candidates from the same party will be able to compete in open SRV general elections. As such, the party function of endorsement and membership should be clearly articulated to the voters.</li></ul>

<p><strong>Phase 3: Go Big at Home - the 2020 Vision</strong>

<p>Oregon, right now, for sure, should reform her Presidential Primary Election, and we've got a proposal we think makes sense. We call this new system the <strong>Oregon Poll</strong>.

<ul>
<li>Right now, only Oregonians in a major political party get a voice in the Presidential Primary, and even they are limited to expressing an opinion about only candidates in their own party. The new Oregon Poll will allow <strong>all voters</strong> to score <strong>all primary candidates</strong> regardless of the party (or not) of the voter or candidate. Parties can choose to accept the results of only their own affiliated voters, but Oregon will publish the full scoring and pairwise preference totals of all of the voters as well.<br><br></li>

<li>Right now, the Oregon primary happens so late in the season, we have a minimal impact on the outcome. When we remove the need for the state and local primary election, we can move the date of the Oregon Poll to have a more meaningful voice. <strong>Let's make that Tuesday actually Super</strong>.<br><br></li>

<li>By running the Oregon Poll on a meaningful date and using the best-in-class system that clearly shows the will of the whole electorate, Oregon will have an outsize impact not just on the outcome of the race, but on the national understanding of voting systems and equality. Mic drop.<br><br></li>
