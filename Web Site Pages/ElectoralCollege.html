<p>The mission of <a href="http://equal.vote">Equal.Vote</a> is embedded in our name. Even though our initial focus is on the <a href="srv">mechanics of the vote</a> itself, when folks keep asking us, "Is this about the Electoral College?", we have to say yes to that too.

<p>The Electoral College was <a href="http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/debates_719.asp">originally created to give slave states more political power</a> in the choice of the president on account of the right to vote being more prevalent in the free North, despite the fact that the founders thought the popular vote was actually the best way to get an "Executive Magistrate of distinguished Character."

<p>Amending the U.S. Constitution to abolish the electoral college is a serious PITA, so some clever folks figured out a way to do this on a state-by-state basis. It's called the <a href="http://www.nationalpopularvote.com/">National Popular Vote</a>. Basically, as long as 270 Electoral College votes worth of states sign on, they all agree to send electors to the winner. Oregon is currently NOT a signatory to the National Popular Vote; despite the efforts of some legislators, our Legislature as a whole has been unwilling to pass it.

<p>Because our mission is true equality amongst the voters, Equal.Vote is fully aligned with and will petition alongside the National Popular Vote effort. <a href="join">Join Equal.Vote</a> and we'll keep you in the loop how to pitch in on the effort.
